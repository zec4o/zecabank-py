# ZecaBank 🏦

ZecaBank is a simple, command-line banking experience designed for learning Python. This project allows you to practice fundamental Python concepts while exploring basic money operations like depositing, withdrawing, and checking your account statement.

## Python Concepts Reinforced 🚀

1. **User Input and Output:**

   - The project extensively uses `input()` to receive user choices and amounts.
   - `print()` statements are employed to provide feedback and display information to the user.

2. **Conditional Statements:**

   - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) control the flow of the program based on user choices and account conditions.

3. **Loops:**

   - A `while` loop is used for the main program flow, allowing the user to interact with the banking system until they choose to exit.

4. **String Formatting:**

   - String formatting is utilized, such as f-strings, to display information concisely.

5. **Error Handling:**

   - The program includes error handling to guide users when they enter invalid values or attempt operations that don't comply with the rules.

6. **Break and Continue Statements:**
   - The `break` statement is used to exit a loop when a condition is met.
   - `continue` is used to skip the rest of the loop and move to the next iteration.

## How to Use 🌟

1. Run the `zecabank.py` script with `python zecabank.py`.
2. Follow the menu to choose your operation.

## Operations 💰

- **Deposit (d):**

  - Add money to your account.

- **Withdraw (w):**

- **Exit (q):**
  - Leave the ZecaBank.

## Usage Tips 🚨

- Follow the prompts to enter values and select operations.
- Check error messages for guidance.
- The app limits you to 3 withdrawals "daily", each capped at $500.
